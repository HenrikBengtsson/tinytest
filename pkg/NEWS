version 0.9.4

- Test files are now sorted in "C" locale (bytewise by filename) to
  improve platform independence of running order. This default can
  be overwritten.
- Global settings set by 'options' and 'Sys.setenv' in a test file are
  automatically removed after running a test file. This improves independence
  between test files. This default can be overwritten, see Chapter 3 of the
  'Using tinytest' vignette.
- New function 'setup_tinytest' that adds 'tinytest' infrastructure to a
  package source directory.
- Fix in 'expect_warning' and 'expect_error'. In some circumstances evaluation 
  argument 'current' evaluated in the wrong scope, resulting in unfound variables.
- Resolved some inaccuracies in the documentation
- More control over testing packages in 'R CMD check' with extra arguments
  to 'test_packages'.
- When running tests from a file, the reported call is equal to the source
  expression when it is short. For multiline expressions the result of
  'match.call' is now used. This improves output printing when expect_* 
  functions are programmed over, e.g. within 'if' or 'for' statements.

version 0.9.3 
- New function 'expect_identical'
- All functions of the form 'expect_lol' can now also be called as 'checkLol' 
  (similar to, but not the same as 'RUnit' syntax)
- Expect_* functions now have first argument 'current' and second argument 'target'
- Added 'summary' method for objects of class 'tinytests'
- Default test directory is now 'inst/tinytest'
- Fix: 'as.data.frame' crashed on tinytests object with all tests passing.
